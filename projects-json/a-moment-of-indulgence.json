Forget everything and take a moment to indulge in a sensory treat… do it for yourself.</p>\n<p>It all started with a photo of a pretty, red polka dot tea set. Though I’m not particularly fond of tea, it struck me how beautiful and photogenic the act of pouring in itself is, especially in the right setting. And how personal it feels. Initially I just wanted to make my own version of that photo, but the more I researched, the more I found myself seduced by the sensual shapes of these beautiful objects. So I set out to create a series based on the idea of tea / coffee break and the moods associated with it.</p>\n<p>It’s a personal, ongoing, exploratory project, to experiment with different styles, textures, light, moods. I barely started and I’m having a lot of fun with it.</p>\n<div class=\"pics\">\n![Pour me a cup of tea](jpg)\n![A moment for yourself](jpg)\n![Sweet indulgence](jpg)\n![Vintage touch - 1](jpg)\n![Vintage touch - 2](jpg)\n![Zen moment](jpg)\n![After rain comes the sun](jpg)\n</div>\n","gallery":["a-moment-of-indulgence-pour-me-a-cup-of-tea.jpg","a-moment-of-indulgence-a-moment-for-yourself.jpg","a-moment-of-indulgence-sweet-indulgence.jpg","a-moment-of-indulgence-vintage-touch-1.jpg","a-moment-of-indulgence-vintage-touch-2.jpg","a-moment-of-indulgence-zen-moment.jpg","a-moment-of-indulgence-after-rain-comes-the-sun.jpg"]}
