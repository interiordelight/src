{"description":"The previous project excited me so much that I set myself to explore the different possibilities of organizing a small space...","body":"<p>The “<a href=\"/portfolio/yummy-green\">Yummy green</a>“ studio seemed like the perfect subject for the exercise, since I already had a solution for it.</p>\n<p>I greatly admire modern Scandinavian (interior) design, not only for its ability to blend beauty and creativity with practicality, but also for its sheer boldness. I took inspiration from it when I designed this layout that displays a regular bed. IKEA’s Kivik sofa, with its small, one person modules is a great choice for narrow places and the stool can be used as either a seat or a table. The wardrobe, media center and other storage cabinets have been combined in one large, compact wall unit, while the balcony has been turned into a private play-and-work space. The parapet separating the balcony from the rest of the room received a tabletop for meals or drinks. Additional storage can be found underneath the bed.</p>\n<p>Dominated by white, northern interiors, particularly Swedish, are pigmented with bright, saturated colours and large texture prints. It’s a great way to turn your living space from dull to exciting and inspirational.</p>\n<div class=\"pics\">\n![Picture 1](jpg)\n![Picture 2](jpg)\n![Picture 3](jpg)\n![Picture 4](jpg)\n![Picture 5](jpg)\n![Picture 6](jpg)\n![Picture 7](jpg)\n![Picture 8](jpg)\n</div>\n","gallery":["northern-odyssey-picture-1.jpg","northern-odyssey-picture-2.jpg","northern-odyssey-picture-3.jpg","northern-odyssey-picture-4.jpg","northern-odyssey-picture-5.jpg","northern-odyssey-picture-6.jpg","northern-odyssey-picture-7.jpg","northern-odyssey-picture-8.jpg"]}
