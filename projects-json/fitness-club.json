The obvious solution was to go with light colours and smooth, glossy surfaces, to brighten the space. But the club’s activity profile, in my opinion, required a design that radiated joy, energy and an overall feeling of well-being. I assigned each room a bright colour and used large, dynamic prints on the walls to create a stimulating environment that motivates the clients to engage with their all in the club’s programs. The graphic elements and branding panels have been designed according to each room’s designation. Colour was also used, together with lighting fixtures, to break the flatness of a long and narrow hallway.</p>\n<p>After months of exploring and modifying solutions, the remodelling is finally finished and, apparently, the clients are very excited about it.

Spanning over more than 18 months, while the club continued to operate, the project was subject to many changes and, eventually, some of the original activities were dropped entirely. However, since a lot of effort was put into creating the design, I decided to post the rest of the images:</p>\n<div class=\"pics\">\n![Hair and nails 1](jpg)\n![Hair and nails 2](jpg)\n![Hair and nails 3](jpg)\n![Hair and nails 4](jpg)\n![Hair and nails 5](jpg)\n![Cosmetics 1](jpg)\n![Cosmetics 2](jpg)\n![Cosmetics 4](jpg)\n![Cosmetics 6](jpg)\n![Top 1](jpg)\n![Fitness 1](jpg)\n![Fitness 2](jpg)\n![Fitness 3](jpg)\n![Pool day](jpg)\n![Pool night 1](jpg)\n![Pool night 2](jpg)\n![Pool night 3](jpg)\n![Counseling earlier 1](jpg)\n![Counseling earlier 2](jpg)\n![Counseling earlier 3](jpg)\n![Counseling earlier 4](jpg)\n![Office earlier 1A](jpg)\n![Office earlier 3](jpg)\n![Office earlier 2](jpg)\n![Office earlier 4A](jpg)\n![Office earlier 5](jpg)\n</div>\n","gallery":["fitness-club-rec-1.jpg","fitness-club-rec-2.jpg","fitness-club-rec-3.jpg","fitness-club-hall-1.jpg","fitness-club-hall-2.jpg","fitness-club-hall-3.jpg","fitness-club-hall-4.jpg","fitness-club-hall-5.jpg","fitness-club-hall-6.jpg","fitness-club-hall-7.jpg","fitness-club-hall-8-final.jpg","fitness-club-massage-n1.jpg","fitness-club-massage-n2.jpg","fitness-club-massage-n3.jpg","fitness-club-spin-final-1.jpg","fitness-club-spin-final-2.jpg","fitness-club-spin-final-3.jpg","fitness-club-spin-final-4.jpg","fitness-club-counseling-final-1.jpg","fitness-club-counseling-final-2.jpg","fitness-club-counseling-final-3.jpg","fitness-club-office-final-1.jpg","fitness-club-office-final-2.jpg","fitness-club-office-final-3.jpg","fitness-club-office-final-4.jpg","fitness-club-women-1.jpg","fitness-club-women-2.jpg","fitness-club-women-3.jpg","fitness-club-men-1.jpg","fitness-club-men-2.jpg","fitness-club-men-3.jpg","fitness-club-girls-1.jpg","fitness-club-boys-1.jpg","fitness-club-hair-and-nails-1.jpg","fitness-club-hair-and-nails-2.jpg","fitness-club-hair-and-nails-3.jpg","fitness-club-hair-and-nails-4.jpg","fitness-club-hair-and-nails-5.jpg","fitness-club-cosmetics-1.jpg","fitness-club-cosmetics-2.jpg","fitness-club-cosmetics-4.jpg","fitness-club-cosmetics-6.jpg","fitness-club-top-1.jpg","fitness-club-fitness-1.jpg","fitness-club-fitness-2.jpg","fitness-club-fitness-3.jpg","fitness-club-pool-day.jpg","fitness-club-pool-night-1.jpg","fitness-club-pool-night-2.jpg","fitness-club-pool-night-3.jpg","fitness-club-counseling-earlier-1.jpg","fitness-club-counseling-earlier-2.jpg","fitness-club-counseling-earlier-3.jpg","fitness-club-counseling-earlier-4.jpg","fitness-club-office-earlier-1a.jpg","fitness-club-office-earlier-3.jpg","fitness-club-office-earlier-2.jpg","fitness-club-office-earlier-4a.jpg","fitness-club-office-earlier-5.jpg"]}
