{"description":"Competition project to design a standard dorm room for 4 architecture students...","body":"<p>The theme of this contest was designing a standard dorm room for 4 architecture students. We were suppose to create modular furniture pieces to combine at least 2 functions: sleeping and study, sleeping and storage or study and storage, plus a dining area, all within a 2,000 EUR budget (materials only), which had to be detailed. We had to choose between 4 rooms (each from a different city) according to our geographical location. Although this was the largest room of the four (24 sqm), my aim was to design a standard framework on which it is possible to build solutions for different/smaller rooms as well.</p>\n<p>“College is about three things: homework, fun, and sleep… but you can only choose two”. I liked this quote, but I wanted to create the environment that would enable the students to pick all three.</p>\n<div class=\"pics\">\n![Picture 1](jpg)\n![Picture 2](jpg)\n![Picture 3](jpg)\n![Picture 4](jpg)\n![Picture 5](jpg)\n![Picture 6](jpg)\n![Picture 7](jpg)\n![Bed structure](png)\n![Plan - picture 1](png)\n![Plan - picture 2](png)\n![Sections](png)\n![Picture 8](jpg)\n![Picture 8 with additional filters](jpg)\n![Picture 9](jpg)\n![Picture 9 with additional filters](jpg)\n![Picture 10](jpg)\n</div>\n","gallery":["students-dorm-room-design-picture-1.jpg","students-dorm-room-design-picture-2.jpg","students-dorm-room-design-picture-3.jpg","students-dorm-room-design-picture-4.jpg","students-dorm-room-design-picture-5.jpg","students-dorm-room-design-picture-6.jpg","students-dorm-room-design-picture-7.jpg","students-dorm-room-design-bed-structure.png","students-dorm-room-design-plan-picture-1.png","students-dorm-room-design-plan-picture-2.png","students-dorm-room-design-sections.png","students-dorm-room-design-picture-8.jpg","students-dorm-room-design-picture-8-with-additional-filters.jpg","students-dorm-room-design-picture-9.jpg","students-dorm-room-design-picture-9-with-additional-filters.jpg","students-dorm-room-design-picture-10.jpg"]}
