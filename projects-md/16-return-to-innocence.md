It is so close! I am already thinking about it with anticipation. The fun and magical season when we all become children again and rejoice over little things, because they seem so different in the Christmas tree lights, they smell better, they taste heavenly...

I did these images for fun and practice, in anticipation of the real thing. It is my first attempt at modelling and rendering a Christmas scene. I used my previous project as setting for this Holidays arrangement.
