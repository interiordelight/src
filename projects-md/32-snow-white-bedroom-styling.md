title:        Snow White bedroom styling
color:        A695B5
description:  Intended to look like a styling photo shoot, this is my entry for the "Snow White" competition held by Design Connected. It was one of the three winners.

A very interesting experiment both style-wise and technically, inspired by the photography of photo stylist Paulina Arcklin. Since I have never worked with so many fabrics, nor have I done such purely white interiors, it forced me to find ways to differentiate between the numerous layers of "white" and get enough depth and character with a very limited palette.
