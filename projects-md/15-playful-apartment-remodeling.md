The project, intended for a young couple, started from the need to create a proper lounge area. The initial access to the living room was in place of the open shelves, while the one used in the project was closed with glass bricks. The room layout and multiple openings in the walls made it hard to furnish, which led to the necessity of reconfiguring the space. The solution also intends to create as much storage space as possible, as this is always one of the major problems in a house.

I chose to finish the walls and floors in neutral colors, instead using textures, various patterns and colorful, fun accessories to spice up the place. The only exception is the kitchen, where I painted one wall in a strong color in order to change the room's proportions. I also used light to personalize each space according to it's function, but also to create a cozy atmosphere. The ultimate goal was to design a neat, functional and, at the same time, fun and friendly living space.
