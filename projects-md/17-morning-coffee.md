I was provided a kitchen 3D model and asked to equip, accessorize and render it in a personal style. I made a few adjustments to the cabinets and added some details (the table-top with chairs and the shelves on the back side of the cabinets). Materials, colours and decorations were left to my decision. I had in mind a beautiful, late Sunday morning with a hot cup of coffee.
