One of the most challenging and dynamic projects I’ve been involved in, the expansion of the fitness club "[Body Exprim](http://www.bodyexprim.ro)" was also a very important learn-by-doing process.

Located on the first floor of an old two levels building, the project implied taking over and remodelling the ground floor in order to make room for new sport activities and supplement space for existing ones.

The open plan allowed us some degree of freedom in configuring the space, however the resulted rooms were smaller than we had hoped for and the ceiling was quite low. The obvious solution was to go with light colours and smooth, glossy surfaces, to brighten the space. But the club’s activity profile, in my opinion, required a design that radiated joy, energy and an overall feeling of well-being. I assigned each room a bright colour and used large, dynamic prints on the walls to create a stimulating environment that motivates the clients to engage with their all in the club’s programs. The graphic elements and branding panels have been designed according to each room’s designation. Colour was also used, together with lighting fixtures, to break the flatness of a long and narrow hallway.

After months of exploring and modifying solutions, the remodelling is finally finished and, apparently, the clients are very excited about it. For actual photos, please visit the [club's website](http://www.bodyexprim.ro) for a virtual tour.

The scale of the project was quite large, as original plans included an extension to the existing building to accommodate an indoor semi-Olympic swimming pool and a beauty salon. Spanning over more than 18 months, while the club continued to operate, the project was subject to many changes and, eventually, some of the original activities were dropped entirely. However, since a lot of effort was put into creating the design, I decided to post the rest of the images:
