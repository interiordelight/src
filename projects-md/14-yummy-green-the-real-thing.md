There are but little changes compared to [the original project](/portfolio/yummy-green), and the design is a complete success. The owners' worst fear was that such amount of furniture in a small space will make it look cramped and scanty. The result was beyond anybody's expectations: a functional and well organized space that is roomy, comfortable and playful.
